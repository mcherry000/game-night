## 🎮 Prompt🎮

Give the player a challenge: get as high a score as possible without dying!
The idea is this: When you collect all the stars the first time it will release a bouncing bomb. The bomb will just randomly bounce around the level and if you collide with it, you die. All of the stars will respawn so you can collect them again, and if you do, it will release another bomb.
